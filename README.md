# trame-mplrt
trame realtime matplotlib update
trame-mplrt is a python application that runs in your web browser. It can be used for real-time visualization of file data as lines in a matplotlib figure.
Specifically, trame-mplrt reads the history file history.csv of the CFD software SU2 and plots the residuals in real-time. However, it is easy to make it read a different file and show different contents, as long as the contents of the file can be read as column data.
